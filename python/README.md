Dreamfactory Scripting Examples for Python

NOTE: DreamFactory Python scripting requires 'bunch' package to be installed on server.

If working from a bitnami instance do the following in a terminal before using python scripts:  
```sudo apt-get update```  
```sudo apt-get install python-pip```  
```sudo pip install bunch```

If you use Python 3, then you have to install the 'munch' package. Use the following scripts to install munch:
```sudo apt-get update```
```sudo apt-get install python-pip3```
```sudo pip3 install munch```

Python 2.7 syntax should be followed as this is the default version of python installed with DF instances (bitnami).
